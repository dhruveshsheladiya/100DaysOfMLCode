# 100DaysOfMLCode
Machine Learning is the most transformative technology of our time. Whether its helping us discover new drugs for major diseases, fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless. In order for us as a community to be able to make valuable contributions to the world, we need to master this technology. This is a call to action, a battle cry, a spark that will light a movement to radically improve the state of humanity. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.My version of 100 days of code by writing code to support my ML learning journey

Motivated from Siraj Raval's 100 days ML Challenge: https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code

# Day 1 - Roadmap and Deciding What to do.
I took the first day of this challenge to really figure out what I can do in order to best use these 100 days to learn and also build something useful. I landed on this idea, whenever I do ML project or participate in online ML competitions there are some pieces of code especially for exploreation which are super repetitive, I can use the 100 days to write out the code for each of these, test it and publish. on day one I created a small helper function which can be used to prettily pring out how many missing values I have in my data. All commits for a given day are named as such.
